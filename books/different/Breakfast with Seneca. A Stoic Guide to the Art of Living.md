## 1. The Psychology of Money

**Author:** Morgan Housel  
**Overview:**  
Rather than a how‑to manual of spreadsheets and ratios, Housel explores the emotional and behavioral dimensions of finance.

**Key Themes:**

- **Patience & Compounding:** Recognizing time as your ultimate ally.
    
- **Tail Events:** Preparing for rare, high‑impact market moves.
    
- **Behavior Over Analysis:** Controlling fear and greed.  
    **Daily Exercise:**  
    Each morning, list one financial decision made yesterday that was driven by emotion. Reflect on how you might reframe it rationally.

## 2. Your Money or Your Life

**Authors:** Vicki Robin & Joe Dominguez

- **Frugality with Purpose:** Distinguishing needs from wants.
    
- **Financial Independence:** Building a lifestyle that no longer requires trading time for money.  
    **Daily Exercise:**  
    Keep a “life‑energy ledger”: record every expense, assign a time‑cost (hours worked), and at week’s end, review which outlays aligned with your core values.

**Author:** Robert T. Kiyosaki  
**Overview:**

### How to Choose and Apply

1. **Match to Your Stage:**
    
    - Just starting out (high debt, low savings): _Your Money or Your Life_, _Total Money Makeover_.
        
    - Building a cushion and investing: _Richest Man in Babylon_, _Millionaire Next Door_, _Psychology of Money_.
        
    - Optimizing advanced portfolios: _Little Book of Common Sense Investing_, _I Will Teach You to Be Rich_.
        
2. **Daily Reflection:**  
    — As with **Breakfast with Seneca**, pair each reading with a “Stoic Practice”: a short journaling prompt, a picayune experiment (e.g., voluntary poverty), or a targeted meditation on your relationship to money.
    
3. **Group Accountability:**  
    — Consider a weekly “finance circle” where you and peers share one insight and one action step—mirroring Seneca’s epistolary style of communal learning.
    

By working through one text at a time and anchoring lessons in daily rituals, you will develop not only the technical skills of budgeting and investing, but also the inner discipline and perspective that transform wealth from mere numbers into genuine freedom.
