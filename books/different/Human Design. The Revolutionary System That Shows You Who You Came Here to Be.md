### üß¨ **Core Concept: What is Human Design?**

Human Design is a **system of personality analysis** that reveals how you're uniquely wired to interact with the world. It is based on your **birth data (date, time, and place)** and generates a **BodyGraph**, a visual chart representing your energetic configuration.

The system identifies:

- **Type** (how your energy operates)
    
- **Strategy** (how to make correct decisions)
    
- **Authority** (your internal decision-making compass)
    
- **Centers** (energy hubs, similar to chakras)
    
- **Channels and Gates** (influences and traits)
    
- **Profile** (personality archetype and life themes)

### üîÑ **Origins and Influences**

Human Design was channeled by **Ra Uru Hu** in 1987 after a mystical experience. It combines:

- **Western astrology** (planetary positions)
    
- **I Ching** (64 hexagrams = 64 gates in the BodyGraph)
    
- **Kabbalah‚Äôs Tree of Life** (channel pathways)
    
- **Chakras** (7 ‚Üí 9 centers in the Human Design system)
