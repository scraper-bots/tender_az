## Part I: Foundation (Months 1–3)

### 1. Mindset & Commitment

- **Long-term focus**: Treat your venture like a legitimate business from day one—avoid “hobbyitis.”
    
- **Willingness to learn**: Embrace continuous testing, failure, and iteration as integral to growth.
    
- **Time management**: Block out dedicated “deep work” sessions to build critical foundations.
    

### 2. Choosing Your Niche

- **Customer-first approach**: Identify underserved markets by talking directly to potential customers.
    
- **Passion vs. Profit**: Balance personal interest with market demand; prioritize solvability of customer pain points.
    
- **Competitive analysis**: Map existing solutions, price points, and brand narratives to spot white-space opportunities.
    

### 3. Product Selection & Validation

- **Low-risk testing**: Source inexpensive samples or small inventories to validate product appeal.
    
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Launch a simplified version to gauge demand without overcommitting capital.
    
- **Metrics to watch**: Click-through rate, add-to-cart rate, and early customer feedback are leading indicators.
