## Overview

_Rich AF_ is structured to guide readers from foundational money-management skills through to advanced strategies for accelerating wealth accumulation. It is organized into three parts—Mindset, Mechanics, and Momentum—each one building on the last:

1. **Mindset** focuses on uncovering and reshaping limiting beliefs around money.
    
2. **Mechanics** lays out concrete systems for budgeting, saving, investing, and debt reduction.
    
3. **Momentum** shows how to scale these systems—through side hustles, career planning, and optimizing tax strategies—to achieve a compounding effect on net worth.
    

Throughout, Tu weaves in real-world case studies from her clients, as well as actionable worksheets and checklists.

## Key Themes

### 1. **Money Mindset as Foundation**

- **Scarcity vs. Abundance**: Tu argues that most financial struggles stem from a scarcity mentality—an ingrained fear that there’s never “enough.” She guides readers through exercises to reframe this belief, such as gratitude journaling around existing resources and tracking small wins in savings or debt reduction.
    
- **Self-Worth & Spending**: The author highlights the link between self-esteem and spending behaviors. By identifying “money scripts” learned in childhood, readers can consciously break patterns of retail therapy or guilt-driven splurges.
    

### 2. **Building a Practical System**

- **Zero-Based Budgeting**: Tu advocates a modern spin on zero-based budgeting, where every dollar is assigned a purpose—whether that’s essentials, savings, debt repayment, or “fun money.”
    
- **Automating for Consistency**: Setting up automatic transfers to savings and retirement accounts is stressed as the most reliable way to build wealth passively.
    
- **Debt Snowball vs. Debt Avalanche**: Both methods are explained, with guidance on choosing the right one based on psychological motivation (snowball) or mathematical efficiency (avalanche).
    

### 3. **Investing with Confidence**

- **Core-Satellite Portfolio**: The book explains how to structure a portfolio with broad, low-cost index funds as the “core,” and higher-conviction individual positions or thematic ETFs as the “satellites.”
    
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Tu walks through the decision tree for whether to contribute to 401(k), IRA, or taxable brokerage accounts, emphasizing employer match capture and long-term growth.
    
- **Dollar-Cost Averaging & Rebalancing**: Step-by-step processes are provided for maintaining asset allocation and taking advantage of market volatility.
    

### 4. **Scaling Income and Net Worth**

- **Side Hustles & Passive Income**: From freelancing to digital products, Tu categorizes popular side-income streams by time commitment, startup cost, and income potential.
    
- **Leveraging Career Growth**: Negotiation tactics, continuous skill development, and networking strategies are covered to maximize salary progression.
    
- **Tax Optimization**: For higher-earners and entrepreneurs, the book delves into strategies such as retirement plan deductions, Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and business expense planning.
