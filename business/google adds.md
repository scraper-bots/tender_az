Below I’ll give a thorough, step-by-step explanation so you can (A) understand the difference between Google’s advertising products, (B) choose the right path for a publisher, (C) implement ads on your website, and (D) set up and receive payments. Where the facts are time-sensitive I cite Google’s official help pages so you can follow the source and replicate exact steps.

# 1) Quick but crucial distinction: **Google Ads** vs **Google AdSense**

- **Google Ads** is the advertiser side (companies pay Google to show ads on search results, YouTube and the Display Network). You _buy_ ads there.
    
- **Google AdSense** is the publisher side (website owners add AdSense code to their pages and _earn_ when Google serves ads on their site). If your goal is to **monetize your website** and _get paid_, AdSense is the product you want. For clarity, the rest of this reply focuses on **AdSense** (how to add ads and get paid). (Intro / starter page: Google AdSense). ([Google AdSense](https://adsense.google.com/start/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Google AdSense - Earn Money from Your Website with Monetization"))

# 2) Before you apply — eligibility & checklist

Google will review your account and site. Before applying, make sure you meet the basic requirements:

1. **You must be 18+** to hold your own AdSense account. If under 18, a parent/guardian may sign up and receive payments. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9724?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Eligibility requirements for AdSense - Google Help"))
    
2. **You must own/control the website** (able to add HTML or verify ownership). ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7584263?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Connect your site to AdSense - Google Help"))
    
3. **Content & policy compliance** — original content, clear navigation, no disallowed content (adult, copyrighted material posted without rights, promoting illegal activities, etc.). Google reviews the whole site against AdSense Program Policies. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7584263?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Connect your site to AdSense - Google Help"))
    
4. **Technical basics** — a working domain (not a parked domain), pages accessible to Googlebot, and a reasonable amount of content so the review can judge the site. Ads won’t show until the site is approved. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7584263?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Connect your site to AdSense - Google Help"))
    

If any of the above are missing, address them before applying — it speeds approval and reduces chances of rejection.

# 3) How to add AdSense ads to your site (step-by-step)

There are two main approaches: **Auto ads** (fast, one snippet) or **manual ad units** (precise placement).

A — **Create an AdSense account and add your site**

1. Go to AdSense and sign in with your Google account; follow the sign-up flow and add your site URL. Google will request you to connect the site for review. ([Google AdSense](https://adsense.google.com/start/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Google AdSense - Earn Money from Your Website with Monetization"), [Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7584263?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Connect your site to AdSense - Google Help"))
    
2. Connect the site by placing the AdSense verification/AdSense code snippet into the `<head>` of the pages you control (AdSense will crawl the page and perform the review). AdSense gives sample code like this (you paste into `<head>`):
    

```html
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

(Replace `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your publisher ID provided in AdSense.) ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7584263?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Connect your site to AdSense - Google Help"))

B — **Auto ads (recommended for quick start)**

- Place the AdSense code once on all pages (above). Auto ads analyze your pages and automatically place ad formats where they’re likely to perform well. This is easiest and often recommended when you are starting. You can later fine-tune types and locations from the AdSense UI. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9261805?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "About Auto ads - Google AdSense Help"), [Google AdSense](https://adsense.google.com/start/solutions/auto-ads/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Using Auto Ads for Content Monetization - Google AdSense"))
    

C — **Manual ad units**

- In the AdSense dashboard you can create ad units (responsive, display, in-feed, in-article, etc.) and copy/paste the generated snippet to the exact place in your HTML where you want the ad to appear. Use manual placement if you need precise control or do A/B testing.
    

D — **Platform-specific helpers**

- If you use WordPress, there are plugins (Site Kit by Google) or theme widgets to place ads without editing raw HTML. Many hosted platforms (Blogger, Shopify, etc.) have their own flow. See Site Kit or your host’s documentation. ([Site Kit by Google](https://sitekit.withgoogle.com/documentation/troubleshooting/adsense/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AdSense - Site Kit by Google"), [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-google-adsense-to-my-website-26808?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Add Google AdSense to my website - GoDaddy"))
    

E — **ads.txt** (recommended)

- Publish an `ads.txt` file at `https://yourdomain.com/ads.txt` that authorizes AdSense to sell inventory on your domain. AdSense provides the publisher line to include (e.g., `google.com, pub-0000000000000000, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0`). This prevents some types of seller spoofing and is recommended. ([Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/adsense/platforms/transparent/ads-txt?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ads.txt section - AdSense for Platforms | Google for Developers"), [Setupad.com](https://setupad.com/blog/ads-txt-guide-for-publishers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ads.txt Guide: Implementation, Benefits, and Best Practices 2025"))

# 4) Approval & first ads: what to expect

- After you add the code and connect the site, Google reviews the site (usually a few days; sometimes 2–4 weeks). You’ll see status in the AdSense “Sites” panel. Ads will start serving only after approval. Make sure the pages you placed the code on are pages that receive regular traffic — otherwise the crawler may not evaluate them effectively. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7584263?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Connect your site to AdSense - Google Help"))

# 5) How AdSense earnings and payments work (process + timing)

This is a common source of confusion — here’s the precise flow:

1. **Earnings accrue daily as “estimated earnings”** in the AdSense account. At the start of the following month Google finalizes the previous month’s earnings (they reconcile invalid traffic, adjustments, etc.). ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1709858?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Steps to getting paid - Google AdSense Help"))
    
2. **Payment threshold**: your payments are issued only after your account reaches the payment threshold for your currency/country. For many publishers the threshold is USD 100 (or equivalent), but the exact threshold can vary by country/currency — check your Payments settings. If you haven’t hit the threshold the balance rolls over to the next month. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1709858?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Steps to getting paid - Google AdSense Help"), [MonetizeMore](https://www.monetizemore.com/blog/the-adsense-payment-threshold-explained/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The AdSense Payment Threshold Explained - MonetizeMore"))
    
3. **Processing window**: if your finalized balance has reached the threshold and there are no holds (identity/address verification, tax forms, missing payment method), Google starts a **21-day payment processing period** and then issues payment. In practice many publishers see payments on or around the 21st of the following month (but arrival time depends on payment method/bank). Example: if you reached the threshold in January and met all verification steps, payment is typically issued at the end of February (processing window applies). ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1709858?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Steps to getting paid - Google AdSense Help"))
    
4. **Arrival time**: how long funds take to appear in your bank depends on the payment method and your bank’s processing times (EFT/direct deposit is usually faster than wire or check). ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3372975?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Receive payments by wire transfer - Google AdSense Help"), [Advanced Ads](https://wpadvancedads.com/adsense-payment/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AdSense Payment or how and when does Google AdSense pay"))

# 6) What you must set up to actually _receive_ the money

To get paid you must complete several items in your AdSense **Payments** profile:

1. **Payments profile & primary payment method** — add your bank account (EFT/direct deposit) or an available method for your country. In Payments → Payment info → Manage payment methods you can add a bank account and mark it primary. AdSense will show which payment options are available for your country. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1714397?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Add your payment method for AdSense or AdSense for YouTube"))
    
2. **Address verification (PIN)** — when your balance reaches a small verification threshold Google mails a PIN to your payments address. You must enter that PIN in AdSense to verify the address; otherwise payments are held. Typical delivery is a few weeks; instructions are in the AdSense account. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7497307?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Enter your PIN to verify your payment address - Google AdSense Help"))
    
3. **Identity verification / tax info** — depending on your country and account type, Google may require identity verification and/or tax forms (especially if you earn from US advertisers or YouTube). Complete the tax forms and identity verification in the Payments settings; failing to do so can place a payment hold. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1709858?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Steps to getting paid - Google AdSense Help"), [TaxQube](https://taxqube.co.uk/how-to-submit-google-adsense-tax-form-dont-overpay-us-taxes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to submit Google AdSense Tax Form | Don't Overpay US Taxes ..."))
    
4. **Remove payment holds** — ensure you have set a valid payment method, entered the PIN, and completed tax/identity steps. If any of these are outstanding Google will hold payments until resolved. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1709858?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Steps to getting paid - Google AdSense Help"), [AdPushup](https://www.adpushup.com/blog/google-adsense-payment/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Adsense Payment: Overview, Methods, Threshold, and Schedule"))

# 7) Payment methods — what to expect (country variance)

Google supports several payment methods, **and which are available depends on the publisher’s country**:

- **Electronic funds transfer (EFT / direct deposit / bank transfer)** — the most common and recommended for speed and reliability (Google transfers to your bank in account currency). ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1714397?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Add your payment method for AdSense or AdSense for YouTube"))
    
- **Wire transfer** — available in some countries for sending USD/EUR via bank wire. It’s secure but may incur bank fees and sometimes takes longer. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3372975?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Receive payments by wire transfer - Google AdSense Help"))
    
- **Other methods historically used**: check by mail, Western Union, Rapida — availability depends on region and Google has been moving toward digital bank transfers in many markets. Always check the “What payment options are available in your country?” link in your Payments settings. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1714397?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Add your payment method for AdSense or AdSense for YouTube"), [MonetizeMore](https://www.monetizemore.com/blog/adsense-payment-methods-which-is-the-safest/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Best Google AdSense Payment Methods [2023] - MonetizeMore"))
    

**Action:** after you create your AdSense account, open Payments → Payment methods → “What payment options are available in your country?” to see exactly which methods Google offers for Azerbaijan (or whichever country is listed in your payments profile).

# 8) Practical checklist you can follow right now

1. Confirm you meet eligibility (18+, own the domain, original content). ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9724?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Eligibility requirements for AdSense - Google Help"))
    
2. Create AdSense account at adsense.google.com and add site URL. ([Google AdSense](https://adsense.google.com/start/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Google AdSense - Earn Money from Your Website with Monetization"))
    
3. Paste the AdSense `<script>` into the `<head>` of your pages (or install Site Kit/WordPress helper). ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7584263?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Connect your site to AdSense - Google Help"), [Site Kit by Google](https://sitekit.withgoogle.com/documentation/troubleshooting/adsense/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AdSense - Site Kit by Google"))
    
4. Choose Auto ads (fast) or create manual ad units (if you want exact control). ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9261805?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "About Auto ads - Google AdSense Help"))
    
5. Publish `ads.txt` on your root domain with the publisher line AdSense gives you. ([Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/adsense/platforms/transparent/ads-txt?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ads.txt section - AdSense for Platforms | Google for Developers"))
    
6. After approval: in Payments set your **payment method**, enter tax info if requested, and complete address PIN/identity verification. Only then will payments be issued when your balance reaches the threshold. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1709858?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Steps to getting paid - Google AdSense Help"))

# 9) Common pitfalls and tips

- **Don’t click your own ads** or encourage others to click them — that’s policy violation and can lead to account suspension and forfeiture of earnings. (AdSense policies). ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7584263?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Connect your site to AdSense - Google Help"))
    
- **Ads not showing after approval?** Make sure your code is in the `<head>`, the site was added in the “Sites” list, there’s no robots.txt blocking Google, and you published the exact pages Google used for review. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7584263?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Connect your site to AdSense - Google Help"))
    
- **Earnings lower than expected?** Ad placement, content relevance, visitor geography, and ad formats matter. Manual placement + experiments often outperform default Auto settings for mature sites. ([MonetizeMore](https://www.monetizemore.com/blog/how-implement-adsense-auto-ads/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How To Best Implement AdSense Auto Ads - MonetizeMore Tutorial"))
    
- **Country specifics** (payment methods, local taxes, banking rules) vary — always verify the Payments settings in your AdSense account for exact options for your country. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1714397?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Add your payment method for AdSense or AdSense for YouTube"))

# 10) Next steps I can help you with (pick any)

- Walk you through creating the AdSense account step-by-step and where to paste the code in your actual HTML (if you paste your site’s head snippet I can show where to add it).
    
- Create a small WordPress/HTML example showing how to place Auto ads and one manual ad unit.
    
- Check the exact payment methods and thresholds for _your country_ (I can look up Azerbaijan specifically if you want).
    
- Draft the `ads.txt` content you should publish (I just need your publisher ID once you have it).
