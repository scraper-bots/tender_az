Improving a **job aggregation website** for Google search visibility (SEO) requires a combination of **technical SEO, content strategy, and authority building** ‚Äî but with job sites, you also have to consider **Google Jobs indexing** and **duplicate content issues** that many aggregators face.

Here‚Äôs a **detailed step-by-step plan** tailored for your situation:

---

## **1. Technical SEO Optimization**

Because job aggregators often deal with large volumes of listings, your site‚Äôs crawlability and performance are critical.

### **a. Crawlability & Indexing**

- **XML Sitemaps**
    
    - Create **dynamic sitemaps** for job listings, categories, and blog content.
        
    - Update them **daily** or in real-time as new jobs are added.
        
- **Robots.txt & Noindex**
    
    - Block thin/duplicate job detail pages from crawling if they‚Äôre low value.
        
    - Keep only **unique, enriched listings** indexable.
        

### **b. Page Speed**

- Jobs often have high bounce rates; slow load = lost users and rankings.
    
- Use **Core Web Vitals optimization**:
    
    - Lazy-load images
        
    - Minify JS/CSS
        
    - Use a CDN for global reach
        

### **c. Structured Data (Schema Markup)**

- Add **JobPosting schema** to each job detail page:
    
    - `title`, `description`, `datePosted`, `validThrough`, `employmentType`, `hiringOrganization`, `jobLocation`
        
    - This makes your listings eligible for **Google for Jobs** results.
        
- Also add **BreadcrumbList schema** for navigation clarity.

## **2. Content Strategy**

Google doesn‚Äôt rank ‚Äújust listings‚Äù very well if they look identical to every other aggregator ‚Äî you must add **original value**.

### **a. Enrich Job Listings**

- Avoid pure copy-paste from source sites.
    
- Add:
    
    - Salary ranges (if missing from the source)
        
    - Company insights (Glassdoor ratings, review summaries)
        
    - Application tips
        
    - Related job suggestions
        

### **b. Create Supporting Content**

- Write **blog posts & guides** around:
    
    - Career tips (‚ÄúHow to prepare for a tech interview in 2025‚Äù)
        
    - Industry trends (‚ÄúTop 10 in-demand IT jobs in Azerbaijan‚Äù)
        
    - Resume optimization advice
        
- These **target informational keywords** and attract backlinks.
    

### **c. Category & Location Pages**

- Create **SEO-friendly landing pages** for each job type + city combo:
    
    - Example: `/it-jobs-in-baku/`
        
    - Include unique intro text, not just a listing grid.

    - Description: _"Browse the latest marketing jobs in Baku. Apply online. Fresh listings updated every day."_
