# Think and Grow Rich — Napoleon Hill

**Comprehensive summary (detailed, formal)**

**Overview (one-paragraph précis)**  
_Think and Grow Rich_ (1937) by Napoleon Hill is a self-help classic that synthesizes Hill’s study of dozens of highly successful people (including interviews and anecdotes about industrialists of his era) into a practical philosophy of personal achievement. The work asserts that wealth — broadly defined as any objective a person values — is primarily the result of mental attitudes, clearly defined desire, focused belief, persistence, organized planning, and cooperative alliances (the “master mind”). Hill translates those ideas into thirteen practical principles and a set of mental and behavioral disciplines intended to produce success. The book mixes prescriptive steps, illustrative anecdotes, and metaphysical ideas (notably about the subconscious and a “sixth sense”), and concludes with an admonition to identify and eliminate common fears that block accomplishment.

# Structure and chapter summaries

## Introduction / Prefatory material

Hill explains his origin story: a commission from industrialist Andrew Carnegie to study success and distill the common traits of successful people. He frames the book not only as a guide to accumulating money but as a philosophy of achievement applicable to any definite goal.

## 1. Desire — The starting point of all achievement

Hill insists that a burning desire is the first and most important step. He gives a six-step formula for turning desire into its financial equivalent: fix a definite amount, determine what you will give in return, set a date, create a definite plan and begin immediately, write a clear statement of the plan and read it twice daily aloud while visualizing attainment. The core message: vague wishes produce vague results; specific, emotional commitment produces action.

## 2. Faith — Visualization and belief in attainment

Faith is presented as a state of mind that can be induced by affirmation and repeated autosuggestion. Hill treats faith as a psychological force that conditions the subconscious and motivates consistent action. He links faith to the repetition of clear, affirmative statements about one’s goals.

## 3. Autosuggestion — The medium for influencing the subconscious mind

Autosuggestion is the practice of consciously feeding your subconscious with positive, goal-oriented statements. Hill argues that repeated, emotionalized affirmation transforms belief and therefore behavior. Autosuggestion is the technique that operationalizes desire and faith.

## 4. Specialized Knowledge — Personal experience or observation

Hill distinguishes general education from specialized knowledge applied toward a specific purpose. He encourages acquiring or accessing specialized knowledge (through study, hiring, alliances) and using it strategically.

## 5. Imagination — The workshop of the mind

Creative imagination (generating new ideas) and synthetic imagination (rearranging existing ideas into new combinations) are essential for devising plans and for turning desire into practical form. Hill emphasizes that imagination is the source of plans and methods that achieve wealth.

## 6. Organized Planning — The crystallization of desire into action

Plans must be made and executed. Hill offers guidance on forming practical plans, testing them, making adjustments when they fail, and forming a group (master mind) to supply additional ideas and support. He cautions against procrastination and emphasizes the importance of immediate action.

## 7. Decision — Mastery of procrastination

Successful people make decisions promptly and change them slowly. Hill identifies indecision and procrastination as major causes of failure. He attributes the habit of indecision often to fear — especially fear of criticism.

## 8. Persistence — Sustained effort necessary to induce faith and success

Persistence is the will to continue despite setbacks. Hill argues that persistence is a habit that can be developed through discipline and repeated effort. He provides practical advice for strengthening persistence (definite motive, strong desire, supportive environment, alliance with others, definite plan).

## 9. Power of the Master Mind — The driving force

Hill introduces the “Master Mind” concept: a coordinated group of individuals who harmonize their efforts and knowledge. Combining resources and minds creates a synergy that provides greater force than the sum of individuals. He treats this as a crucial multiplier of thought into action.

## 10. The Mystery of Sex Transmutation

Hill claims sexual energy, when redirected (transmuted) into creative and productive outlets, becomes a powerful driver of ambition, imagination, and persistence. This chapter is framed psychologically (energy and emotion converted into other forms of achievement).

## 11. The Subconscious Mind — The connecting link

The subconscious stores and executes the suggestions fed into it by conscious thought, especially those repeated with emotion. Hill holds that by controlling conscious thought (through autosuggestion, faith, and disciplined emotion), one programs the subconscious to produce constructive behavior and opportunities.

## 12. The Brain — A broadcasting and receiving station for thought

Hill uses a quasi-metaphorical model: the brain both broadcasts one’s mental attitudes and receives impressions from other minds; this explains intuition, inspirations, and the phenomenon of ideas that “seem” to come from nowhere.

## 13. The Sixth Sense — The door to the temple of wisdom

The “sixth sense” is described as an undefined faculty that yields flashes of insight, hunches, and inspiration once the other principles are well-developed. Hill treats it as the apex of his system: when desire, faith, autosuggestion, specialized knowledge, imagination, planning, decision, and persistence are in place, the sixth sense will provide practical guidance beyond ordinary reasoning.

## Appendix: Six major fears (and how to outwit them)

Hill identifies six basic fears — poverty, criticism, ill health, loss of love, old age, and death — and suggests methods (rational analysis, autosuggestion, work on self-confidence) to neutralize these fears which otherwise block success.

# Key recurring themes and claims

- **Thought precedes reality.** Hill’s core proposition is that focused thought + belief + disciplined action shape outcomes. Thought is causative, not merely reflective.
    
- **Definiteness of purpose.** Success begins with a clear, written goal and a burning desire to achieve it.
    
- **Mental conditioning.** Repeated affirmations and autosuggestion reprogram the subconscious to support achievement.
    
- **Collective intelligence and leverage.** No one succeeds in isolation — organized collaboration and mastery of relationships (the Master Mind) accelerate results.
    
- **Persistence + planning = inevitability.** Repeated, persistent execution of plans eventually yields success if the plan is sound and refined.
    
- **Psychological over mechanical.** The emphasis falls on changing inner states (belief, fear reduction, mental discipline) rather than on any single external technique.

# Illustrative anecdotes (representative examples Hill uses)

- **Edwin C. Barnes** — persistent ambition to be associated with Thomas Edison; Hill uses Barnes to illustrate how definite desire and persistence created eventual partnership.
    
- **Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, Alexander Graham Bell, Charles M. Schwab** — used as exemplars to show how notable success conformed to Hill’s principles.  
    (Hill’s narrative uses many period anecdotes to illustrate application of his rules.)

# Practical, step-by-step applications (how Hill expects you to use the book)

1. **Create a definite written statement** of the amount you desire and the time limit for its attainment; describe what you will give in return and create a plan. Read it aloud twice daily with emotion.
    
2. **Practice daily autosuggestion/affirmation** to build faith and mental conditioning.
    
3. **Acquire specialized knowledge** or assemble people who have it (hire, partner, or form a Master Mind group).
    
4. **Use imagination** to craft and refine plans; convert imagination into organized planning and immediate action.
    
5. **Make prompt decisions** and avoid procrastination.
    
6. **Develop persistence** by disciplined repetition of your plan and by linking strong motives (why you want the goal).
    
7. **Form a Master Mind alliance** of two or more people who contribute knowledge and resources and who will support and hold you accountable.
    
8. **Monitor and neutralize fear** — identify which fears limit you and use rational analysis and autosuggestion to reduce them.
    
9. **Remain open to intuition** (the sixth sense) once other disciplines are established.

# Strengths of the book

- **Clarity and structure.** Offers a repeatable, highly memorable set of principles (the 13 steps).
    
- **Action orientation.** Encourages concrete habits (written statements, daily affirmations, forming groups, planning).
    
- **Motivational power.** Its rhetoric and anecdotes are effective at inspiring persistence and the formation of concrete goals.
    
- **Enduring influence.** Many modern productivity and goal-setting systems trace ideas back to Hill’s thesis (goal specificity, visualization, accountability groups).
    

---

# Criticisms and limitations (balanced, modern perspective)

- **Anecdotal and non-scientific.** Hill’s method relies heavily on anecdotes and correlation rather than controlled evidence of causation. His interviews and sources are sometimes opaque or secondhand.
    
- **Overemphasis on thought/attitude.** The book can underplay structural, systemic, or external constraints (market conditions, inequality, access to capital, discrimination) that materially affect outcomes. Thought alone cannot substitute for structural resources, luck, or timing.
    
- **Metaphysical claims.** Concepts such as the “sixth sense,” telepathic elements of the Master Mind, and other quasi-occult notions are presented without empirical support and may strike modern readers as speculative.
    
- **Cultural and historical datedness.** Examples, references, and some language reflect the 1930s industrial context and may seem anachronistic today.
    
- **Ethical ambiguity.** Hill emphasizes results and desire for riches but provides limited guidance about the ethical means of achieving ends; unscrupulous methods could be rationalized under similar rhetoric.
    
- **Gender and social bias.** Some content and examples assume a male breadwinner model and the norms of Hill’s era.

# Concrete, modern-oriented takeaways (how to extract value today)

1. **Translate “desire” into SMART goals.** Convert Hill’s “burning desire” into Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound objectives.
    
2. **Use affirmation and rehearsal pragmatically.** Combine positive self-talk with evidence-based habit formation and deliberate practice.
    
3. **Prioritize specialized knowledge and networks.** Hill’s emphasis on expertise and alliances is validated by modern research on social capital and skill acquisition. Build a targeted learning plan and a peer/advisor network.
    
4. **Treat planning and iteration as central.** Hill’s advice to make plans, test them, and revise when they fail aligns with modern lean-startup and experimental approaches.
    
5. **Build accountability structures.** The Master Mind is an early articulation of peer accountability groups; replicate with mentors, advisors, or mastermind cohorts.
    
6. **Address fears and mental barriers with evidence-based methods.** Combine Hill’s mental disciplines with cognitive-behavioral techniques to reduce fear and procrastination.

# Final evaluation (brief synthesis)

_Think and Grow Rich_ remains a foundational text in the personal-development canon. Its greatest value is rhetorical and procedural: it insists on clarity of purpose, the psychological importance of belief and persistence, and the practical power of coherent plans and cooperative networks. Readers who adopt its disciplined planning and networking prescriptions often find measurable benefit. However, it should be read critically: combine Hill’s mental techniques with contemporary knowledge about skills, markets, ethics, and evidence-based psychological methods. Treat Hill’s metaphysical claims as historical artifacts rather than empirical fact, and adapt his action steps to modern contexts and realities.
