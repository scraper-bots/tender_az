Great — you’re asking the exact practical question every one-person tools portfolio hits when it becomes a (small) business: “one domain + one analytics/AdSense” vs “many domains + many setups.” Below I give a formal, detailed recommendation (with technical steps, examples and a short checklist) so you can act immediately. I also include why I recommend one approach and when to choose the alternative. I cite authoritative sources for the key claims.

# TL;DR — recommended approach

**Buy one brandable domain and host every app as a section (subdirectory) or subpath on that domain (e.g. `yourdomain.com/password-generator`, `yourdomain.com/qr`) — run a single Google Analytics (GA4) property and a single AdSense publisher account for the whole domain.**

Why: it’s the lowest cost and maintenance approach, consolidates SEO authority (backlinks, domain trust) and makes analytics and ad management simpler — while still letting each tool be a “page” or “mini-app” that ranks on its own. ([Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/blog/subdomain-vs-subdirectory/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Subdomain vs. Subdirectory: What They Are & Which Is ..."), [Weglot](https://www.weglot.com/guides/subdirectory-vs-subdomain?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Choosing Right: Subdirectory or Subdomain for Enhanced ..."))

---

# Rationale (detailed)

1. **SEO authority consolidation (subdirectory advantage).**  
    Content in subdirectories (example: `yourdomain.com/tool-name`) inherits the domain’s authority and internal linking more directly than content split across separate new domains; SEO practitioners often prefer subdirectories to “concentrate” ranking power for niche sites/tools. If you want organic search visits to grow with minimal extra SEO labor, a single domain with clear subpaths is the fastest path. ([Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/blog/subdomain-vs-subdirectory/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Subdomain vs. Subdirectory: What They Are & Which Is ..."), [HigherVisibility](https://www.highervisibility.com/seo/learn/subdomain-vs-subdirectory/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Subdomain VS Subdirectory: Impact on SEO Explained"))
    
2. **Operational simplicity — one publisher account / one payment.**  
    Google AdSense allows you to manage multiple sites under the _same_ publisher account; Google policy expects one publisher account per person/entity. Using one domain (or many sites added to the same account) keeps billing and policy management simple. You will still need to add and verify each site in AdSense’s **Sites** list. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9729?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "If you want more than one AdSense account"))
    
3. **Analytics & measurement simplicity (GA4).**  
    Best practice for multiple subfolders or subdomains that represent a single product collection is to use **one GA4 property / one data stream** so user journeys, funnels and cross-tool behavior are accurate. This also simplifies event naming, conversions and cohort analysis. (If you later need per-app reporting, you can use filters, events, or separate exploration reports — or create one additional property for a single app that needs strict isolation.) ([Analytics Mania](https://www.analyticsmania.com/post/subdomain-tracking-with-google-analytics-and-google-tag-manager/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Subdomain Tracking with Google Analytics 4 (2025)"), [Google Help](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9679158?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "[GA4] Google Analytics account structure"))
    
4. **Search Console: use a domain property.**  
    Register and verify a **Domain property** in Google Search Console to cover `example.com`, `www.example.com` and all subdomains in one place. This lets you monitor index coverage, performance and security across the whole portfolio easily. ([SEOTesting.com](https://seotesting.com/google-search-console/domain-vs-url-prefix/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Google Search Console Domain vs URL Prefix"), [Google Help](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34592?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Add a website property to Search Console"))
    
5. **When separate domains or subdomains make sense.**  
    Consider separate domains or subdomains if you plan to: sell a single app as an independent product/brand, target completely different languages/markets with dedicated content strategies, or if the apps must be legally or operationally separated (different owners, compliance). Subdomains (e.g., `app1.yourdomain.com`) are sometimes treated as separate properties by search engines — useful if you deliberately want separation — but that doubles SEO/maintenance work. ([FourFront](https://www.fourfront.us/blog/when-to-use-subdomains-and-subdirectories/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Subdomains vs Subdirectories: SEO Best Practices"), [Weglot](https://www.weglot.com/guides/subdirectory-vs-subdomain?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Choosing Right: Subdirectory or Subdomain for Enhanced ..."))

# Concrete recommended architecture (practical)

- **Domain:** buy one brandable domain (examples below).
    
- **URL structure (preferred):**
    
    - `https://yourdomain.com/password-generator`
        
    - `https://yourdomain.com/qr-code`
        
    - `https://yourdomain.com/document-converter`
        
- **Alternative (if you prefer logical separation):** subdomains are acceptable but treat them as part of the same account:
    
    - `https://password.yourdomain.com` (only use subdomains if you have a reason)
        
- **Canonicalization:** ensure every page has a canonical tag pointing to its primary URL (subdirectory version).
    
- **Sitemap:** one XML sitemap listing every tool page; submit to Search Console domain property.
    
- **Robots:** allow the tools you want indexed; disallow any staging / admin paths.
    
- **Internal linking:** add a lightweight “hub” page (yourdomain.com/tools) that links to each tool — this distributes internal link equity and improves UX/SEO.

# Step-by-step checklist to implement now

Use this checklist to move from “deployed on Vercel” to “one domain + GA + AdSense”:

1. **Buy domain** (brandable, short, contains “tools” or nothing): see quick name ideas below.
    
2. **DNS → Vercel**: add domain to your Vercel project and configure root and `www` A/CNAME records; enable automatic HTTPS (Vercel provides certs).
    
3. **Decide URL layout**: migrate each app to `/slug` paths or route them behind a simple hub. If apps are separate repos, configure Vercel rewrites to map `yourdomain.com/appname/*` to each app.
    
4. **Canonical & sitemap**: add `<link rel="canonical">` tags and create `/sitemap.xml` listing all tools (update when you add tools). Submit sitemap to Search Console. ([SEOTesting.com](https://seotesting.com/google-search-console/domain-vs-url-prefix/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Google Search Console Domain vs URL Prefix"))
    
5. **Google Analytics (GA4)**: create a single GA4 property and a single web data stream. Put the GA4 snippet (Measurement ID `G-XXXXXXXX`) on every page. Use the same measurement across subpaths/subdomains. Example snippet (replace `G-XXXX`):
    
    ```html
    <!-- GA4 -->
    <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXX"></script>
    <script>
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
      gtag('js', new Date());
      gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXX', { 'cookie_flags': 'SameSite=None;Secure' });
    </script>
    ```
    
    (If you use GTM, deploy the container once across the domain.) ([Analytics Mania](https://www.analyticsmania.com/post/subdomain-tracking-with-google-analytics-and-google-tag-manager/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Subdomain Tracking with Google Analytics 4 (2025)"), [Google Help](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9679158?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "[GA4] Google Analytics account structure"))
    
6. **Google Search Console**: verify a Domain property (recommended) via DNS TXT record. This covers all subdomains/protocols. Submit your sitemap. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34592?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Add a website property to Search Console"))
    
7. **AdSense setup**: sign into your AdSense account (or create one — one account per publisher). In **Sites → + Add site** add `https://yourdomain.com` and follow AdSense instructions (site ownership and policy compliance). Place the AdSense code on pages once approved. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9729?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "If you want more than one AdSense account"))
    
8. **Privacy & Consent**: add a privacy policy, cookie/consent banner (if EU/UK traffic expected). Declare AdSense use and any data collection. AdSense checks for privacy and contact pages.
    
9. **Ad placement & UX**: start light — responsive in-content banner and anchor ads; avoid intrusive interstitials. Monitor revenue and page speed.
    
10. **Monitoring & errors**: integrate Sentry/console logging for conversion/conversion errors (converters/uploads). Track DAU, bounce rate and top revenue pages.
    
11. **Scale & split tests**: once you have traffic, A/B test ad formats and positions and measure search impressions vs CTR.

# AdSense & policy key points (must know)

- **One AdSense account per publisher** — do not create multiple accounts for the same person. Add multiple sites to the same account. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9729?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "If you want more than one AdSense account"))
    
- **Site ownership & approval:** you must add each site domain/subdomain to the AdSense “Sites” list and meet content/policy requirements. Sites with thin or auto-generated content may be rejected. ([Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/12169212?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Add a new site to your AdSense sites list"))
    
- **Ad experience:** avoid placing too many ads per page and avoid deceptive UX. Provide real user value on each tool page (short explanation, privacy note, how results are processed).
    
- **Privacy/consent:** if you have EU visitors, show consent for non-essential cookies and for advertising. Failure to comply can affect AdSense. (Use a third-party CMP or simple consent banner.)
    

---

# Technical examples & snippets

**robots.txt** (allow indexing, disallow staging):

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /admin/
Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml
```

**example canonical** on a tool page:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://yourdomain.com/password-generator" />
```

**AdSense example** (placeholder `ca-pub-XXXXXXXX`):

```html
<script data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXX" async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- then ad units per page from AdSense UI -->
```

# Domain name ideas (single domain, brandable)

Short suggestions (available/registrations change quickly — treat these as conceptual examples; I can run availability checks):

- `onetools.io`
    
- `tinytools.app`
    
- `handytools.io`
    
- `toolstack.dev`
    
- `microtools.co`
    
- `quickutils.com` (if available)
    
- `clever.tools` (TLD may be pricier)
    
- `yourname.tools` (personal brand)
    

If you want, I’ll generate 20 checked domain suggestions and filter by price/TLD — I can produce those instantly.

---

# When you might still buy separate domains (short)

- You want to sell an app individually or turn it into a SaaS with separate pricing and branding.
    
- The app addresses a very different audience or language and you want absolute separation.
    
- You need to limit legal/financial exposure across products.
    

If any of the above are true, consider subdomains or separate domains — but be aware SEO/maintenance doubling.

# Actionable next steps I can produce for you right now (pick any and I’ll generate immediately)

- A ready-to-deploy **single-page hub HTML** that lists all current apps and routes to your existing deployments (Vercel rewrites example included).
    
- A full **sitemap.xml** for your current list of tools and a `robots.txt`.
    
- A **privacy policy + cookie consent banner** text that mentions AdSense and GA (legal but non-lawyer template).
    
- A short **domain name availability check** list (I can propose names and you pick).
    
- Preconfigured **GA4 and AdSense installation snippets** and where to paste them in a Vercel + Next.js setup.
    

(You already said “I only need domain + GA + AdSense” — I recommend the hub + GA4 + AdSense setup. If you want, I’ll generate the hub HTML + sitemap + privacy policy here — no waiting.)

---

# Final recommendation (single sentence)

If your immediate goal is to monetize the tools quickly and cheaply while maximizing organic growth, **buy one domain, publish each tool under its own subpath, use one GA4 property and one AdSense account, and monitor revenue before deciding to split anything into separate domains.** ([Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/blog/subdomain-vs-subdirectory/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Subdomain vs. Subdirectory: What They Are & Which Is ..."), [Google Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9729?hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "If you want more than one AdSense account"), [Analytics Mania](https://www.analyticsmania.com/post/subdomain-tracking-with-google-analytics-and-google-tag-manager/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Subdomain Tracking with Google Analytics 4 (2025)"))

Tell me which of the immediate artifacts you want me to create **now** (I can generate them in this reply):

1. Hub HTML with cards and Vercel rewrites example.
    
2. `sitemap.xml` + `robots.txt`.
    
3. Privacy Policy + Cookie consent text.
    
4. GA4 + AdSense code snippets and where to paste them (tailored to your stack).
    
5. Domain name list (20, checked conceptually; I can check availability next).
    

I’ll produce the chosen item(s) right away.

Nice — I’ll keep this tightly practical and formal.

Short answer up-front: I recommend you pick a **very short label** (6–8 characters) + the **cheapest credible TLD** (first-year promos: `.site` ≈ **$0.98**, `.dev` ≈ **$6–7**, `.app` ≈ **$6–7** at mainstream registrars). Use the single-domain approach you picked (one domain, all tools under subpaths). Source: Namecheap pricing pages and Porkbun TLD info. ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/site/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "site Domain Registration | Buy .site New gTLD for $0.98"), [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com/tld/dev?utm_source=chatgpt.com "DEV TLD Domain Names"))

Below I give:

1. the **shortest name candidates** (6–8 chars) I recommend,
    
2. the **cheapest TLD choices** and price evidence,
    
3. the **single best pick** (short + cheap + brandable), and
    
4. exact next steps + how I can check live availability for your top 3 picks.
    

---

# 1) Short, cheap, brandable candidate names (6–8 chars)

I filtered for shortness, clarity (signals “tools/util”), and typability.

- **utilio** (6) — very short, “util” + `-io` sound; brandable
    
- **toolhub** (7) — clear, describes a hub of tools
    
- **toolbox** (7) — very recognisable
    
- **onetool** (7) — suggests “one place for tools” (better: `onetools` if plural)
    
- **useful** (6) — short and meaningful, but more general (may be harder to brand)
    
- **toolfy** (6) — brandable made-up word (tool + -fy)
    
- **toolst** (6) — condensed “tools” variant (risky for readability)
    
- **tinyutl** (7) — contraction of “tiny util(s)” (less pretty but short)
    

(If you want absolute shortest possible, we are constrained by availability — most 3–5 letter English words and common short blends are already taken or premium. The 6-8 char range gives the best balance.)

---

# 2) Cheapest TLD choices (what to buy) — evidence & guidance

- **`.site`** — often the cheapest promo first year (Namecheap currently lists `.site` promotional price ≈ **$0.98** first year). `.site` is inexpensive and neutral for a tools collection. ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/site/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "site Domain Registration | Buy .site New gTLD for $0.98"))
    
- **`.dev`** — developer-focused, credible; Namecheap shows `.dev` promo ≈ **$6.98** first year (renewals higher). Use `.dev` if you want dev credibility and HTTPS enforced. ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/dev/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "dev Domain Registration | Buy a .dev New gTLD for $6.98"), [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com/tld/dev?utm_source=chatgpt.com "DEV TLD Domain Names"))
    
- **`.app`** — app-focused TLD also commonly priced around the same ballpark as `.dev` on promos. Good if you want “app” signal. (Registrar promo pricing fluctuates.) ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/dev/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "dev Domain Registration | Buy a .dev New gTLD for $6.98"))
    
- **`.online` / `.website`** — sometimes in the $1–3 promo band; visible but less brandable than `.dev`/`.app`. (Namecheap shows `.online` and `.website` promo ranges.) ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/site/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "site Domain Registration | Buy .site New gTLD for $0.98"))
    

Important: many registrars offer **very low first-year prices** for some TLDs (e.g., $0.98), but **renewal prices** can be much higher — always check renewal cost before purchase. Namecheap and Porkbun are good places to compare because they frequently run promos and include privacy. ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/dev/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "dev Domain Registration | Buy a .dev New gTLD for $6.98"), [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com/products/domains?utm_source=chatgpt.com "porkbun.com | Domain Name Pricing"))

---

# 3) My best “shortest + cheapest” pick (one recommendation)

If you want the shortest credible brand + the cheapest first-year cost, my single recommendation is:

**`utilio.site`** (label = `utilio`, TLD = `.site`)

- `utilio` is 6 characters (short, readable, evokes “utility”).
    
- `.site` is usually available at the lowest promo price (≈ $0.98 first year at major registrars). ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/site/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "site Domain Registration | Buy .site New gTLD for $0.98"))
    

Alternative credible picks:

- **`utilio.dev`** — slightly pricier first year (~$6.98) but looks more “developer” professional. ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/dev/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "dev Domain Registration | Buy a .dev New gTLD for $6.98"))
    
- **`toolhub.site`** or **`toolbox.site`** — slightly longer but extremely clear; still cheap on `.site`.
    

---

# 4) How to check _live availability & exact cheapest price right now_ (quick, 2 options)

**Option A — Fast manual check (two clicks)**

1. Open Namecheap domain search: use their Domain Name Search page (type the domain + TLD). Example: `utilio.site`. Namecheap will show availability and price. ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Domain Name Search | Free Check Domain Availability Tool"))
    
2. Open Porkbun’s search page and repeat — Porkbun often has competitive pricing & honest renewal info. ([porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "porkbun.com | An oddly satisfying experience."))
    

**Option B — Let me check for you**  
Tell me your **top 3** preferred short labels from the 8 I listed (or add your own 3). I’ll check live availability and the cheapest registrar price (Namecheap, Porkbun, and one other) and return **the best buy option** (registrar, price, first-year and renewal). — I can do this now for the three picks you give me.

---

# 5) Quick purchase & setup checklist (once you pick a name)

1. Buy domain at cheapest registrar (check renewal before purchase).
    
2. Enable WHOIS privacy (most registrars include it free — good for privacy).
    
3. Point DNS to Vercel (add domain in Vercel; follow Vercel’s DNS instructions — it will give you the records).
    
4. Enable automatic HTTPS (Vercel will issue certs).
    
5. Add GA4 snippet and AdSense once domain is approved. (I can provide the exact code and where to paste.)
    

---

# 6) One small caution

Very cheap first-year TLDs (e.g., $0.98) frequently **renew** at a much higher rate — check both first-year and renewal pricing before buying. Namecheap’s `.site` promo is cheap first year but renews higher; `.dev`/`.app` renewals also differ. I cited Namecheap TLD pages above for reference. ([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/site/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "site Domain Registration | Buy .site New gTLD for $0.98"))

---

If you want me to check live availability and **return the single cheapest buy (registrar + price + renewal)**, please paste **your top 3** picks from the short list above (e.g., `utilio`, `toolhub`, `toolbox`) and I’ll look them up immediately and return exact purchase guidance.
