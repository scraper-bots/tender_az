**Guiding Question:** Which data or expert predictions bolster your vision?

i think health is most important part of the our life.
everyone trying to be careful with their healthcare.
even they did not aware.
but today healthcare systems especially data related part is almost not exists.
and it is understandable.
because Azerbaijan third level country.
and healthcare also thirty level from the ground
but right now some part of the systems trying to integrate to the e-government application.
maybe it can be beginning of the digitalization and data collection.
I hope.
but it is not our topic.
now let's imagine we have fully digitalized healthcare data collecting and storing system.
there is some question in here:
	1.what is value of this system?
	2.how we can use system to improve healthcare?
	3.who will use this data?
	4.how we can protect this data from greedy corporations?
	5.is there only access belong to the government?
6.especially data context is there any potential threat to human freedom?
there is more questionable parts of this data.
but i can imagine some of them.
let's try to address them one by one:
this system can be valuable for collecting the data.which doctors can use past diagnose to understand of individual issues from long data patterns.so it has potential value is unimaginable. on the other hand AI has unpredictable development, which we will not need for some cases to doctors. but we can not replace doctors entirely i think for at least 5-10 years. but most cases we need to doctors only interpretation for analytics of results. basically we need doctors for data interpretation. and only part is there which important is DATA. so we can easily paste this data to feeding specialized LLM or any AI form. which it also can interpret easily. in most case also better than human. due to nature of human doctors also vulnerable for reducing attention of details. in this AI models can be better solution than human doctors. so this kind of AI integrated system can be herald of the better future for individual that can not reach for expert level healthcare. and also this can reduce healthcare cost tremendous amount. if we should summarize this question it has potential of increase average life longness and even for low-income individuals.
actually i was answered most of this question. we can reduce costs through AI integration. also now individuals should not go to the hospital for every health issues. value can be listed here like that: reduced time, reduced costs, reaching more individual, increasing average lifetime and etc.
it is most important part that this should not reach by which trying to control humans in micro granular level. once i read a book about use case of the data. there is one case which i can feel a fear about human kind. this case about predicting pregnant of individual. basically it is classification of customer which buyer of Target market chains. is pregnant. and pregnant individuals are holy grails of market chains. this kind of classification can be valuable for target marketing. after while some costumers of this market chain are trying comply of this marketing program which his girl is not pregnant. she was only scholar age. but later this dad called back for apology even he was not aware of that his girl is pregnant but company knows about it. someone can even laugh this case. but it is fearing. imagine if company can classify through buying pattern individual woman is pregnant or not. what happens when we whole life healthcare data seized buy this greedy corporates. what kind of customer target can happen here is just endless. question 3,4,5 is should answer only one thing. can we sure that: all of the healthcare data will not selling to the third party? actually i am not sure about that. even it was anonymized data there is still realistic threats for reaching this individual from another data with data mapping. let's imagine you reached this but it is anonymized with person related ciphering. but any hospital can reach who is that person through his own data mapping with timestamp and other tools. on the other hand is the government should be only guard? is there any threat by government. answer sorry full YES. maybe some of you heard about company PALANTIR. this company has different level access to government data. but most of them are related to the individual control. and it is not shiny future for who want to be truly free. basically freedom is not our hand. they can predict who will selected in the next president selection. also they can predict who will select this president. basically from social media data. and if you want as a question what is threat here about healthcare data. oh my friend you do not have any clue what can be done with data. i just can show you one use you can imagine others yourself. lets think you going to hospital or phsycolog for mental treatment. and wow you have all brain related data in their hand. your talkings, your feeling your mood and etc. all this data can predict is this person can be threat to next campaign to the next law which most of us do not like or is this person can be killer? some of you can think it is actually good for reducing crime. oh lets think what happen wrong classifcation? 3-4 month ago i was heard case which law enforcements using AI to catch the criminal which is guilty for some crime. and they found a girl which is also pregnant. luck of him this crime recored by the camera. and can easily show by human she is not guilty. even it is basic mistake but what happens she was not pregnant. how will be end of this case. AI today is not interpretable. most of predictions are coming from neural network which basically can not be understandable for most of use. we can only assign some scores to some features. is this enough for the predicting some criminal case. in this case it was related to lack of the data. if this model has access to the camera recording that showing humans this individual body size does not fit this girl body size it can show different results. but even if someone can found with this trained model how we can poof this person is guilt only with his healthcare data? it is not correct. 

it is compeletly wrong.
