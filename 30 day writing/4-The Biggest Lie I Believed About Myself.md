When grauduated from the university I was believed only one thing for being happy individual in among my peers: Find a stable job.

But when found a job it is being a simply enough for 4â€“6 month. 
After this period I am starting to search for new job. 
Basically if this job is boring not challanging enough I can not bear this environment. 
After several career change I was realized I am not pursuing job or money. 
Basically I do not care any of them All I need challange and challanging collegues which I can be in competition with them. 
But instead of that i was always most advanced tech guy in the team. 
Literally one technicall man in among non-tech. 
It was hard to keep you skills sharpened. Also chatbots evolving so fast i was using them almost every task. 
Most of time i was trying challange myself through different projects or leetcode or hackerrand and etc.
But after some point I was realized that it s not sustainable approach.
Instead of fighting with AI i decided move with AI as partner.
And I do not need to work for someone. 
I need only money.
And why I should not go to money. 
An i was started to build products which has values.
And this products is not simple.
But i can not find sttil how to gain money from them.
