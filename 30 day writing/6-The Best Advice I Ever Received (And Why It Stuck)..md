Actually it is hard to tell what kind of advice i had received and did it. 
Because of my nature I do not care about anyone and what they told me as advice.
I think each has unique life.
No one past is the same with someone. 
All of us coming from different place of life.
So advices are just useless.
My friends most time tell me do not go coffeshop, do not spend money in restaurants or something like that.
Okay it is good advices.
They do not have bad intention.
But it is not me.
I am not the person of the saving.
I want to live life fully.
So want I want to tell avices are not for me.
Maybe in sometime I was accepted advices but I do not remember any ot them.
My life is mine and mine alone.
