Most of the time i am trying to wake up at 5 o’clock.
After that I am taking shower.
And later going to pray.
Then doing 30 push ups.
After that preparing tea and starting to write essay for daily since I was started 30 day streak.
After that preparing to go to gym.
Then starting to swim.
After 8 o’clock going to work.
Starting to prepare coffee or going to coffeshop.
But sometimes like end of the week it is completly different.
I can not wake up earlier.
Due to hard work my sleep routine completly distrupted.
