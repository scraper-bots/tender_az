if i can start my career from zero i will never no what is true for me this time.
anyway we all doing mistakes
different kind of mistakes.
a lot of mistakes.
but it is not mean we are stupid except me.
i had done a lot of mistakes.
if i had chance to start my career again i will never be today.
but it will never happen.
mistake 1:
	if i have a chance i will start to learn coding to earlier.
mistake 2:
	never stick to one job.
mistake 3:
	if i have a chance i will start to personal development earlier than my 28s.
and this list can be long.
But meaning does not change.
We all are humans.
we can do better, but under exact same situation and same mindset is different thing
So we will never be same.
we leaned that what is wrong
actually i do not care what is wrong or what is true.
during my 30 years life i can not remember a time i was thinked twice.
i am do it persn.
i am not thinker.
i am doer.
so it is normal a lot of mistake.
