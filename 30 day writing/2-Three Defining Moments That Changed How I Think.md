Today I will write about key moments in my life which impacted today who am I.

First moment of my life is related with working as waiter at local restaurant in student years. During this period i attempted to work several time. But i do not know why i can not find any work. At the end somehow I found a job at the restaurant. I worked at this restaurant 3–4 days. 

This was very hard job. 

Everyday was like a torture. Kitchen was first floor. There is not lift for retrieving meals for customers. You should go down and take the meals from the kitchen to the second floor.

This days also was exam period. I had failed my 2 exam. I was came home tired. My sleeping regime was disrupted completly. Work days almost up to 3 am at night. 

During this first experience I was realized several things:

> Money gaining is hard.

> Working with people is hard.

> I am not person who loves to works for someone else.

> Never try to do several things at same time.

Seond time it was my banking job.

After a university i was started to military career then switched to the banking sector. And started to work as loan underwriter. I was manually analyse and documentize customers to identify that is this customer eligible for loan or not. But after two years later bank decided to move automatization. This manual works going to replace with predefined rules which is cheaper than human workforce several times. And I found myself almost at layoff position. It was rare events which I do not know how came this position. And turned back and started to think what I did wrong. Then realized that during this year I was worked for someone that did not care about anyone. This calling corporate. And it is totally normall. Because as every corporate machine this one also focusing to maximize his incomes. And workforce are expensive. But problem is not related their automation decision. Problem was related with me. 

> How I can never see this thing is coming?

> How I was getting slower and consumerism like mindset instead of proactive and get whatever I want?

> How I was get this kind of laziness?

I can not find answer any of them.

But I know fault is mine and mine alone.

What was correct action?

Of course i should go courses , should learn new skills, should learn flexible skills, which during layoff period it should be helpfull for apply different jobs.

But i can not call my self data analyst or backend developer. 

I was going to identity crisis. I do not answer to myself what is my functionality in life. I was trying to find answers to this questions through work functionalities like everyone. But i can’t find.

And someone asks to me what is your job and i can not explain because of job title. 

Because there is not job title. Once i read if your job title more than two words your are at wrong job. After realizing this things in my life i was turned my entire life up-down. 

Personally I do not like lessons or homework. I was never good at my lessons. Best and interesting lesson was history in school for me. It has one core reason if this thing is interesting for me i will read and will be most advance person whatever this thing. But if this is not interesting in best case i will be avarege guy in this field. Like math i was always bad and upper class i was average math scholar. After discover my learning skills i completly understand it is not problem with IQ or stupidity which i was believed during this years. Mathematicians always seemed to me like geniues which they are. But also I should accept that my learning methodology completly different than others. I can read 8 hours one book without any interfere. But i can not spend 3 second which it is not interested to me. After realising this I was started to bound my learning journey something interesting and amusement. During this journey several books helped to me how we can create new habits like lesson and home tasks to do. And when I realised that i need to change my career route I was started 3 course at once. Excell, SQL, Python. 6 day in a week. It was tremendous amount load in my chest. In some point I almost losing my controll for hard tasks. But thanks to my challange loving mindset i can manage somehow. Then i was bound my lessons to coffeshop and coffee drinking. Later when i should do homeworks i going to coffeshop. This was very helpfull. And I was most succesfull student during this course despite that i have not any prior experience in coding. Then applied internall vacancies in my company which i was almost layoffed from work. Thanks for my supervisor support I was accepted to that job. Then started as business analyst. During first years of my job i did a lot of mistakes. But again thanks to my management they was very polite for newcomers. And my salary was reduced almost half times. Thanks to my previous savings i can manage 1–2 years.
