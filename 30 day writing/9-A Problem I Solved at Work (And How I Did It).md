when i was started work i was faced several challanges. 

first times it security blocking all my acces to the necessary privilages.

then started trying to understand what is problem.

problem is not their fault.

problem is corporation related issues and disbelieve to each other.

after several month later i was challenged another acces problem to one of the data platform.

due to nature of our work we need some private data storage which is not accessible to other users.

and again data governance and head of the department is not giving acces to the any of the platform storage.

but after several meetings  they also agreed withme.

and after that i can understand it is not personal problem with me.

this corporation level distrust is everywhere.

and people who works in same place and sharing same building can not trust each other.

it is interesting.

how this happened, how it is even possible.

i can not understand even after 8 years in corporate ladders
