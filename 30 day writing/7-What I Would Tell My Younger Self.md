If i can go to back to 2012 years, i will start to learn coding more earlier. 
That mistake changed my entire life completly. 
I have never imagine how i can not see what is importan in the feature.
Another thing is that i have tremendous interest to build applications , websites and etc.
How this interest not thrived me to coding and development.
Sometimes i think it is related my place and friends.
Maybe i will be in baku during my student years it will be completly different life.
Maybe it is nonsense.
It does not matter.
I can not change past.
And also this thought does not like me "thinking as loser".
Also i would advie my younger version of me start to saving earlier.
Today is not late, but a little bit late.
I do not what kind of mistake i will do in the feature.
But i will try to do my best to keep this list shorter.
