Most people just do not care about their health.

Until it will be late.

But it is important to analyse that every single piece of the data that related with our health is very important.

Today most specialties evolving so fast, people didn't even realize that most of us is the analyst actually data analyst.

In bank we take data from the sql databases and convert this data into insights and insights transform into decisions.

This is not different in healthcare.

We take data from the patients and transform this data into diagnostic data.

Doctors also somekind of analyst.

Despite that source is not sql it is very important field of analysis.

Because human life is important.

And most people do not know this data analyse.

I have simple systematic approach for diagnosing this problem:

- If something wrong happens write this problems.
- Then organize problems.
- Later find which problem fits which diagnose
- An find top1-3 diagnostic to finish your diagnose
- then go to doctor.
- tell exact symptoms.
- wait for doctor reaction
- and ask if not tell you a diagnosis.
- and compare with your finding.
- maybe you missed something
- maybe doctor missed somethinf.
- then tell this unfit diagnose
- then realise what is true

  

Today hl7 like data storing and transfering protocols exists.

But they are very complicated.

And some time i can not skip to ask myself: why they are not using any global data formats like spread sheets or json

I do not know , but I am sure there is a certain reason for that.
