during this years i was tried to learn several technology, including programming languages and no code tools. 
most of time its learning curve was same.
beginning hard ending easy.
but most time my learning is not related to the must do things like you should learn for the you can do your job.
During this year when i turn look at my entire life i can understand that my leaarning is only about passionate.
Not necessarity.
But i do not know how to turn my unwanted things to the learning passionate.
This is downside of the motivation.
When you do not feel motivation you can not do anything.
That is my curse.
I can not do things which is not feels that i like.
